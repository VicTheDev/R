## How to install?

1. Clone or download the repository
2. While in the bot folder, install dependencies by running `npm i`
3. Create a `config.json` file and fill it like this:

    ```json 
    {
      "TOKEN":"Put your token here",
      "PREFIX":"Put your prefix here",
      "MongoKey":"Put your connection string here"
    }
      ``` 
 
Note: to find your connection string check the [MongoDb Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/driver-connection/ "Connect via Your application")

4. That's it! Run the `main.js` file to start the bot!

PS: The bot is running on NodeJS 17.0.1
